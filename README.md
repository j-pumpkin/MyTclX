# My TclX fork #
## Why? ##
Official repo seems to be abandoned as of 06.07.2025. I forked it to make work with Tcl 9.0.
## How? ##
Build and use it as the official version. MinMax function was removed, as separate min and max already exist.
## What to expect? ##
Bugs. I do programming as a hobby, and I don't know C beyond very basics. I will try to keep this fork up-to-date with Tcl API, but don't expect it to be fast and smooth. I am mostly following compiler hints when adding changes.
## Known issues ##
Tests are currently broken, I didn't build it on Windows yet, and I have yet to verify that all parts of the library are working.
